So when I view the... it did better taking me to the dash atlas page on default, but still where it says software access and I click login URL, it does the same thing by just redirecting me to the atlas page where I originally go when I log in. Yeah, so now I'm open to suggestions on this. What do you think we should do?# Claude Environment Setup

## Database Setup

The database connection is set up using a `.env` file with the following content:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_wvPnH3r6TsVf@ep-royal-dawn-a5aax48l.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

## Running the Application

To run the application with environment variables:

```
npm run dev:dotenv
```

This will automatically load the database connection from the `.env` file.

## Workflow Between Claude and Replit

1. Make schema changes in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub
3. Pull changes in Replit
4. Run `npm run db:push` to apply schema changes to the database
5. Both environments share the same Neon database

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the DATABASE_URL error, make sure:
1. The `.env` file exists with the correct URL
2. You're using the `npm run dev:dotenv` script
