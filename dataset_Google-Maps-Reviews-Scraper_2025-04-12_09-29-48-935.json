I found Lewis Heating and Air on Thumbtack with the most star reviews and decided to give him a call… My son was house-sitting while my wife and I were off visiting our new granddaughter when our AC started pushing warm air! My son said the thermostat wouldn't drop below 75… I immediately called Lewis H&A and spoke with Mr Lewis answered and said he could visit the same day after 5 pm to accommodate my son's schedule. Mr Lewis upon his initial review discovered the issue and took pics sent them to me and stated how he would fix the issue. He ordered the part and then provided free advice to prevent the issue from happening again and mentioned he would gladly check back in the fall to provide the Maintenance to get through the winter! Mr Lewis was not only professional but remedied the issue while working to accommodate our schedule. So, I'll return from my trip with a fully repaired AC unit thanks to Mr Lewis Heating and Air! I would highly recommend anyone in need of honest and reputable Heating and Air to call Mr. Lewis at Lewis Heating and Air!",

I figured that’s all it was and was super easy since my AC is running properly. Fast forward to this year I called them again to service it and we set an appt, they never showed, never returned my voicemail and screen every subsequent call I attempted. So I called a friend that does AC and he came out and looked and was shocked that my AC hadn’t locked up because it’s dangerously low on Freon. He checked the unit outside for the Freon level... the guys from McGee never even looked at the unit outside. They took me for a ride, my fault. Now I know better and won’t ever call them again or refer them to anyone. All I can do is warn other people! Terrible business people. If I could give negative stars I would.",

  "text": "Thank you Greg for saving the day. I highly recommend this company to anyone that needs HVAC work. I had a problem with my system that just stopped working,and my thermostat was blank. I thought it was just a bad thermostat so I replaced it, but my system stillwould not kick on, so I called Summers Heating and air ,on a Saturday,  and Greg ,the owner, personally came out in a very timely manner. Found the problem at my outside unit and replaced the part, then programmed my new thermostat for me, which I didn't know had to be done, so that it matched my Rheem unit. Within an hour or so he had everything repaired, back up and running! He is very professional, honest & understanding and the price was more than reasonable. He could've charged me whatever he wanted, especially on a Weekend, but he doesn't mark up his prices and like I said for less than $200 total ,I was all set. WOW, what a great company & awesome customer service!  Thanks again for all your help and I will recommend this company to all my friends and family.",

  "text": "My Air conditioner stopped producing cold air on one of the year's warmest days of the year. Nearly every company I found told me it would be 1-2 days before they could get someone out to me and the additional service call fees would still be  attached. I then came across Wyatt Mechanical services LLC.\n\nI spoke with Stephen Wyatt (Owner) who advised they were a little busy as it was “that time of the year” and that they had their workload cut out for the month. However, he agreed that he would personally stop by to “check it out”. In less than forty-five minutes he arrived. My issue was quickly recognized by him, and it was resolved within an hour.\n\nStephen was kind, well-knowledgeable, and a down to earth person overall. I appreciate your prompt response and the restoration of cool air flow. Without a doubt, I will utilize the business once more and refer others to it.",

This company was recommended to me be a friend who had a good experience so I called. It was during the first warm days of spring and everyone was slammed but Taylor made every effort to get to me in a timely manner. The first impression was a knowledgeable and friendly staff with a very professional truck and equipment. I was prepared for the worst but after a thorough inspection it was diagnosed as a bad starter capacitor. The brand that Taylor uses has a 5 year warranty. It’s unheard of for electronic/electric parts to have any warranty but Taylor explained that he insists on providing premium components for his clients and it saves time and money in the long run. Overall they had me back up and cooling off in no time. . Clear and precise communication combined with prompt service (he gave me a ballpark time and then called 30 minutes before arriving) and professional appearances and extremely reasonable pricing made me feel like I have found a HVAC I can depend on for all my future needs. I can’t speak highly enough about how satisfied I am with the work and new relationship. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of work on there systems.\nA+ experience and I will use them again!",

  "text": "Our air conditioner broke today. I contacted Leo a little after 6 PM, and he arrived around 7 PM. It only took him an hour to fix it. At first, I thought it was a minor issue, but it turned out the motor had burned out due to electrical fuse wear. Leo's inspection and repair were very professional. He also did an evaluation and monitoring for me, telling me which parts could hold up for now and what to keep an eye on. I've had too many repairmen try to convince me to replace things that don't really need replacing, but Leo was very honest and gave advice from my perspective. The final cost was also very reasonable.",

We discuss the different unit options and their benefits. Help with financing if I wish. With this information I was able to make an informed decision and schedule my install. Air logistics personnel were courteous and professional throughout. After finishing the install, in the rain I will add, they made sure everything was clean and all trash was removed.

  "text": "Recently, my friends told me how pleased they were with their new air conditioning system.  So, when the fan on my outside unit stopped cutting off at the end of the cooling cycle, I called my friends for the name and number of the company they had used.  Since I'm so used to leaving a message and then waiting for someone to call back, I was pleasantly surprised when Jeremy actually answered the phone.  I told him my issue, and he said someone would be at my house around 3pm that afternoon, and they were.  I was so impressed with Heath and William. They were very friendly (I do so not like a grumpy service person); not only did they replace the faulty part in the outside unit, they checked everything on the unit in the attic, and the thermostat in the hall to make sure there were no other issues.  Also, they didn't rush to get the job done; they took the time needed to be thorough, and I thought the repair cost was reasonable.  I was very pleased with the service I received and will definitely call Independence Heating and Cooling again.",

We were hired by the seller of the home you purchased to service the HVAC equipment. We were not hired to bring the system up to code, past or present. While we find your situation to be unfortunate, we can not be held responsible for something that has no correlation to what we were hired for by the previous owner. We would recommend, if you don't already, to have a yearly or bi-yearly maintenance plan for your equipment, which would've most likely prevented this from occurring.",

Will we recommend them to friends & family? Another huge YES!",

  "text": "The BEST HVAC Contractor in Woodstock Alabama!\n\nI had a fantastic experience with Superior Heating and Cooling. They are the BOSS when it comes to HVAC services. Scheduling was a breeze, and they arrived right on time. The technician resolved my furnace issues, taking the time to explain everything thoroughly and answer my questions.\n\nWhat stood out to me was their expertise in gas systems, they made the repair process so easy. Superior is affordable and they stayed an extra few minutes to ensure my unit was heating properly. That really made me feel like they did a thorough job to make sure my unit was repaired correctly.\n\nIf you're looking for reliable and skilled professionals for heating and cooling services, I highly recommend Superior Heating and Cooling & Insulation. They have become my go-to for any future HVAC needs, and I'm confident you'll appreciate their outstanding service too.",

Took him to the thermostat he asked me again what was happening and I said I was trying to tell you and he flipped out was yelling at me and stormed out said he had had a stressful day and wasn't doing this. This man and company will never be allowed in my home again as the other reviews say rude and combative is exactly the way to describe it he was mad at me from the start that he was there at all. Not the way a customer who's already made you money should be treated in their home. I was extremely upset after and still can't believe it went that way I'll never call them again and it's a shame I have to pay someone else when this is under their warranty.",

Heather was very kind and helpful with organizing the HVAC replacement. Dan and his Son did an amazing job installing the new unit. We have had no issues for 2 years. We have utilized their maintenance twice a year (spring / fall). Their team are rockstars. The icing on the cake took place last night (Saturday night). We had a lightning storm come through and damaged our system. I texted Heather and she called me back promptly. Although it was afterhours, Dan came right out , within an hour,  and fixed the system quickly. Luckily it was just a capacitor but their friendly, caring, and knowledgeable service significantly impacts my confidence and comfort as their customer. Service like this creates customers for life! I highly recommend them and encourage you to do business with this family owned company!",

After discovering them they will be the only ones that I will ever touch my A/C unit. Dan and his family are very professional and respectful to the customer. They will do what whatever it takes and will go above and beyond to help solve the problem. Thats what I like about them.\n\nBack in 2020 I had a leak in my evaporator coil (at the time it was a 13 year old unit, yes a little old) the first two companies I had come out and instantly said I need a new unit. Dan and his Son came out replace the evaporator coil and had the unit up and running like as if it was new. They didn't try to force / sell me on a new unit, they saw the problem and fixed it without hesitation. If they tell you that you need a new unit it is most likely that you really do and the old unit is beyond repair or would cost just as much to fix.\n\nIf you need any A/C work done this is the family you want to go with. Professional, respectful, honest and down to earth you will not be disappointed.",

  "text": "Awesome Experience using Martin Service Heating and Air! We called two local companies to check out our units after our home was struck by lightning recently.  Martin Service arrived with parts in hand within an hour of us calling them on a Saturday afternoon.  They had us back up and running within hours and charged us thousands less than the other company had quoted and they were able to do the work immediately.  They were super professional, gave us a great price and had everthing installed and cleaned up within just a few hours. The even went the extra mile by following up the next day to make sure we were happy with the repairs.  I highly recommend you use them. They were referred to me by our electrician who said he wouldn't use anybody but them to do work for him.",

Never do you want to second guess or wonder if you are getting the best deal or the job done right. Brad and his team at the Hartselle location just do business the right way. Trust is a commodity they strive to earn, and they are very successful in delivering FAST & QUALITY service at an excellent VALUE. It's rare you find a company, especially in this industry, that has all 3 of these traits. When you find such a rarity, you make sure you don't let it get overlooked. Thank you Brad, Kendra and team for getting me squared away same day in an efficient and effective manner! Keep up the great work!\n\nI called and Tyler said he could fix me up on a Saturday. Only oncall person this weekend and he was an hour away, but Tyler still came out on the weekend and had me going and back working in about 2 hours. Not only did he provide excellent service but he went above and beyond getting under my house and running new thermostat wiring at no extra charge. This company has my business for life! Tyler is the reason. Thank you so much man for giving me the hook up. And to know they are Trane dealers makes this a no brainer to hop in bed with the best in the business!",

But they did, and that's the kind of service and honesty we all expect in our awesome Cullman community, but we may not get honesty and integrity as often as we should.

I reached out via a Facebook question and they private messaged me and said they’d like to help!\n\nThese two young men are very professional and they have continued to reach out to make sure the units are working correctly! Their work is top of the line!\n\nWith our first unit they cleared up our clogged drain lines and added a safety switch to our drain pan so it will cut off if water enters the area! (Hallelujah, thank you!) And it was an inexpensive fix! (too bad we didn’t find them years ago!)\n\nWith our 2nd unit (which hasn’t worked correctly for many years!) they replaced our duct system because our cool air was going under the house! They stayed under our house working over half a day! They also found a leak and recharged our unit with refrigerant.\n\nI hope you will consider them for your heating & cooling needs!

I contacted a different company. The owner came and diagnosed the problem in 30 MINUTES (it was the gas valve!!!)!!!! He had it fixed in 15 minutes once he got the part.

He told us it would be $90 for the service call, with NO MENTION of an hourly labor charge to diagnose the problem. 6 hours and $600 later...OUR FURNACE IS STILL NOT WORKING!!! We only paid $400 because we told him we refuse to pay a dime over that with him having NO CLUE what is wrong. ANY DECENT CONTRACTOR NOT TRYING TO RUN UP A BILL would have reached out for help after the first hour. No, he waits until hour 5 (expecting to be paid for all this wasted time) to FINALLY reach out to his so called \"super-tech\" who did no more than Norwood! So now we not only paid him $400 to NOT fix our furnance, but we had to purchase a heater for another $140 because we have NO HEAT AND IT IS BELOW 40 DEGREES OUTSIDE!!!",

I called him on Labor Day morning, and he came out, recharged the AC, and got it running again. Later that evening, it stopped working again. I called him, and he walked me through some diagnostics over the phone, and I was able to get it running again with his help. I have not had any issues since. Not only did he not charge me for helping me over the phone, but he did not charge me an additional fee for coming out on a holiday.\n\nI highly recommend Mr. Youngblood. He is professional and clearly cares about his customers. I will definitely call on him again if I have any HVAC issues in the future.",

I was tied up in a surgical procedure on Wednesday so I was unable to contact them until Thursday morning.  when their man arrived he looked at the unit and told me it would take a motor.  They called back and told me it would be today, Wednesday before they could get the part.  I called last night to check on the status and left a message on their machine.  This morning I called a little before 0900 and again left a message.  After 3 more calls with no response I called someone else.  I guess they don't service what they sell when it is still under warranty as I bought the unit less than 10 years ago.",

  "text": "From my experience with this business owner, it appeared the goal in mind was the collection of the service call fee.  Due diligence was NOT given to my cooling issue.  I was told in less than 5 minutes after his arrival that my compressor was not coming on.  No other checks were made on my unit, but I WAS told that it’ll be $70 for the service fee.  The capacitor on my home unit was bad, but was NEVER checked.  I even called back within 30 mins of his departure to ask about the capacitor not having been checked.  The person answering the phone informed me that he would give me a call upon his arrival...I have received no call at the time of this post.  After another proprietor came to check the unit later the same day, they IMMEDIATELY checked for a bad capacitor, identified it as the problem, replaced it for $35 plus THEIR service fee, and told me it is good for a year.  I am 100% sure that I will NEVER call Mr. Wilson again and will do all I can to make sure others don’t trust him with their business.  Sadly, I’ve heard of him doing the same thing to other customers.  Now I KNOW their stories are valid.  Avoid frustration for yourself, and keep moving down the list...& I approve this message.",

  "text": "Scam Alert\nEric came out to fix a problem with one of my properties (after looking at it and telling me that it was 2 different things) instead of fixing it, he gave me the excuse that he have other things that he have to do. I tried to see outagood time for him to come back out to fix his findings, he said \"It's going to be 3weeks before he'll have time, he charged me to come out  fees and refuse to do the work. Then have the nerve to tell my tenant that I did not want to pay him that's why he's not doing the work. When he  clearly told me that he don't have time. Which got me wondering, if he didn't have time to do the work why did you go out there to look at the work. I suppose just so he can charge me a come out fees. Now I feel like you intentionally try to rip me off. I have never owed him money or given him excuses why I couldn't pay you for any work he've done for me directly. At the same time, I have every right to understand whatever work you're doing in my properties. Attempt  to reach him was ignored. Good name  is better than money. Asshole",

  "text": "Warning!!!! Never purchase a rheem water heater!!! I purchased a rheem platinum plus from home depot 1 year ago 6 months after purchase it started having issues.Customer service told me I have to find a plumber to repair it because they don't have techs in my area. I live in mobile Al they are made in Montgomery Al (2.5 hrs away) you dont have techs in my area? Red flag. I paid to have it repaired it took 2 months for them to reimburse me...they misspelled my name on the check ( lol). Either my wife or I have to reset it in average every 3 months. I hope no one else has to go through this because of a bad product",

  "text": "I purchased my tank from Home Depot.  Was installed. Within the first month I had no hot water. I called the company, they said to take the gas line off and blow into it, that there must be something from my gas line preventing it from lighting. ??? Really??? But ok, i shut off the gas, took the line and blew it out. Well ok I got it to hear. But after having to do this for two years, several times. The box went, would not allow it to ignite, and it still showed the 3 sec. Light saying everything was working fine! But no hot water. So I said hell with this, called the plumber. The plumber said the box wasn't working correctly. The company sent a new box. He came out installed new box. But noticed that the flame wasn't right. He removed the burner to find that the burner had never burned correctly.  And the sensor was not even attached to the tank. No weld had held it. Tank was redflagged asap. The tank was bad from day one. But they didn't want to replace it, they allowed a defaulted tank to stay in my home. The plumber said I needed a new tank, to contact home depot, take the tank and exchange it. I wouldn't put another water tank from this company in my home. That tank was defaulted, they knew it, and it could have killed me. They should have replaced the tank when I called with the problem from the first call. Not told me to blow into my gas line. Yeah sounds like a joke. And it was. Thank God I'm still here. I still have warranty left, and they still will not admit the tank was faulty. I had a new tank installed to be safe, it's not their brand. It's a Defender by their compation.  No wonder people are straying away. My life is worth more then this. See you in court!",

Being that the June heat is crazy, I wanted the part NOW, so even though I had a part coming to me on order I wanted to buy locally and use my ordered part as a spare as this is a high fail item. I was referred to them by another local business that was out of stock.  Upon arrival, I could tell that the person seemed too bothered to be assisting me and asked me a barrage of questions on what I wanted it for, even though I showed him the exact part, specifications and picture from my phone.  He even said that he did have it but needed to know exactly what brand of my unit was, which to me was a stall tactic since I showed him ALL of the ratings from the part.  So he goes in to I would assume parts office for a few moments and then comes out to tell me that he could not sell the part to me since I was not licensed electrician.  If that was the case, why did he not tell me this before-hand?",

  "text": "We have been working with this distributor and Goodman Manufacturing for 6 weeks now to replace my 1 year old Goodman compressor that failed. I was first told it was under warranty but they could not find the unit anywhere because they had changed the seer rating and my unit was obsolete. Then after weeks of them looking for a unit they could not find one anywhere in the 400 stores they are affiliated with they told me to reach out to goodman and that Goodman would upgrade me to the new seer rating which required the inside air handler to be replaced as well. Which Goodman Agreed to do and I was suppose to get that installed two weeks ago. But on the day we were suppose to go get the new units Johnstone called and said they had now found a unit like I had somewhere \"up north\" and it shipped out on Thursday two weeks ago. Now they cant give me any tracking information they have not gotten and mean while I sit here 6 weeks without air in Florida. Really at this point I am considering hiring an attorney!!  Stay clear they might look good at first but their follow through is ridiculous. Most Johnstone stores are independently owned as this one is the person that owns this one owns at least the one in Dothan AL so I would steer clear of both of these stores.",

The people at Johnstone Supply were helpful, friendly, and appeared knowledgeable on what they were selling. I brought the bad capacitor into the store and the employee took a quick look at it, went to a shelf and picked out the replacement part. It's refreshing to see employees who still know something about the parts and what they stock instead of relying totally on what the computer tells them.I would recommend them to anyone in the area!",

I was charged $125 for getting there before closing ! I was furious. I cared more about taking care of my customer so I paid the lousy fee, nevertheless how much will they lose in the end? I will take my business else where. The only reason i didn’t give them a 1 is because my experiment with them isn’t all bad, but this was a deal breaker!",

  "text": "UPDATE: 12/11/2023\nKristen kept her word and made sure that we got taken care of Leroy and Derek made to to address any and all concerns we had as they fixed the issues with the drain and safety switch. Now a month going strong the unit has shown none of the previous issues and we are very happy.\n\nUPDATE: 11/7/2023\nKristen contacted us about the issues and scheduled a team to come out and fix the issues from initial install. Today a team of four gentlemen came out and repaired the drain issue, installed a new drain safety switch, and verified that the heating and cooling were operating correctly before leaving.\n\nIn May of 2023 because our AC wasn't cooling the house and was blowing warm air. The first company they sent was respectful, helpful, and a pleasure to work with. When the repair was not enough in June 2023 the warranty company sent in a new company, Zippers. The supervisor Jason was quite rude and condescending insisting that if my husband needed to know about what needed to be done that he should call him directly instead of just sending an email with the issues, what need to be fixed and are options. Jason tried to convince me that I I needed to go through them directly and pay out of pocket for a new AC unit in the amount of about $8,500 rather than use my warranty company because the warranty company probably wasn't going to pay more than $1,500 if that much and it could take weeks before they got approval. When I stated I did not have that kind of money lying around to just throw at him to replace the entire AC unit. He said we could just finance with him and he could have that done within 24 hours. Despite me saying multiple times I need to discuss it with my husband and I would like information to share with him. He told me just to have my husband call him and he would discuss what was needed to be done with him so they could come to an agreement. Jason made sure to tell me that if we didn't go through them directly and pay out of pocket, either cash, credit card or through financing that they would not warranty either their work or the parts that they used despite the fact that they ordered all of the parts and they were doing the work.",

She called me back that evening about possibly not needing the dampers and I informed her that they are needed to adjust the airflow to make the reception area cooler. She agreed and told me to go ahead with the installation of the dampers. I received feedback from Cynde that the issues had been resolved and the areas were cooling properly. She received an invoice by email with a PDF attached that shows the detail. \n\nAlso, the above mentioned thermostat is not the same model that I installed. Parts can be purchased from Amazon, but my prices include installation.  \n",

  "text": "I have contemplated on writing this review because this is a local company that was referred to me by a client. However, I felt he utterly ripped myself and my business partner off. We just moved into a new location, we had a few things wrong with our AC, our rooms would be freezing cold and our lobby would be hot. We tinted the windows and installed blinds for the front lobby. Nothing was working. We contacted this gentleman per our clients recommendation, he came out and stated we needed a new thermostat and some dampereners for our rooms to change the airflow. He proceeded to change out our thermostat and charging us $260 for a thermostat, we never agreed for him to change it out immediately and we would have never agreed to this price.\nHe then stated that he would get us some prices for the dampeners. We never heard back, so later that day we decided to not go with the dampeners and reached out to him and stated we decided not to go with the dampeners. He proceeded to tell us that he had already ordered the parts and he will be there the next day to install, so we allowed him to since he's already purchased the product. Meanwhile I start researching why the thermostat cost us this much, I found the same exact product on Amazon and home Depot for $40, so he has a upcharge on his product by $220!! I feel this is a complete rip off!!  To charge a small business $525 for a thermostat change and 2 dampeners to be installed is highway robbery. I would not recommend this company if you are trying to be mindful of cost. He charges without asking and expects his money at the end with no explanation and no detailed receipts. Attached is a picture of the thermostat he installed and what I found online, as well as our invoice he charged. I will make sure I tell every client that walks in my door to avoid this company before they rob you blind.\n\nEdit: the thermostat is a pro1 T701 it's $40 on Amazon. Google will not attach my photos, but I have proof that I'm attaching to yelp.",

He serviced my inside unit and changed the filters and went to the outside unit and done the same. He came back inside and explained everything he had done and told me that the capacitor was weak and that he had notified his office and was told to replace it. He was very professional and offered to answer any questions that I had. I renewed my contract for 3 more years and I hope y’all keep Christian around to do all my service calls. He is definitely an asset to CLIMATEMP!",

After waiting allll day and missing work, no one even had the common courtesy to  call and notify me that my appointment would be rescheduled to a day that I am not available. I called them at 5:00 pm to check the status and spoke to the after hours receptionist who knew absolutely nothing. It’s 100 degrees outside and I have no AC. Everyone on social media will hear about this! I am furious after missing a day of work and still burning alive with an 8 month old irritable baby. Definition of unprofessional. Smh.",

Ultimately determined the compressor blew and likely looking at full replacement based on age of the unit. Sent his assistant Tommy out next day to verify and discuss plans. Ken called following day with a very fair quote and that they could have new equipment and parts ready for install the next morning. Ken was able to shuffle a non urgent job with another client that they already had on their schedule to take care of me. Ken, Tommy, and team showed up next morning, very professional and courteous. Work was wrapped up by lunch with all systems go. Can’t say enough good things about Ken, Tommy and team.

  "text": "Don't use this company I would give zero stars if I could. I had them install a new unit in 2021. It's been one problem after another. The latest problem being that the unit stopped cooling which is suprising since they just came out a few weeks ago to service it for $400. Robbie told me to find someone else to work on it becuase he \"didn't know when he could get someone out\", so I did. The company that came out discovered that Robbie's service guy messed up the schrader valve on the freon line when he was using his gauges during the last service visit, the cap was not put back on correctly and all of the freon leaked out of my system. It took 12 pounds to recharge and cost me over $1000. They also pointed out a bunch of other sloppy things with the wiring and installation. I tried to reach out to Robbie (call / text) so that he could address this and hopefully do something to make it right. Unfoutunately he has decided to ignore / block me. He also did some work for my mom and now I'm learning that she paid him for a part and he never came back to install it. Apparently he has turned into a jackleg.",

Originally darrius white the technician stated that the control bored needed to be replaced. After multiple days of avoiding calls from myself father and the home warranty company darrius replaced the part. It did not solve the problem and he then proceeded to say my compressor need to be replaced. After another week of getting the run around I finally got a new unit for outside. Come to find out the outside unit was the wrong size! 3 ton outside 2 ton inside. When the realization was made darrius came and replaced the unit with the correct size. 2 weeks after replacement my ac unit has gone out again. A  new technician not associated with this company discovered that the unit was not installed correctly and has now ruined the inside unit as well as the outside unit that darrius replaced! This man is completely incompetent unprofessional horrible business owner!! Do not use this company do not let Darrius White near your home!

I've served multiple deployments overseas with the military and can honestly say it is comforting knowing that Barry is just a phone call away should my family need anything while I'm away.  You cannot fathom how much I appreciated having one less thing to worry about.  He and his wife continue to exceed our expectations of quality customer service and care to this day, I needed him twice in the last two weeks for two separate issues and he didn't disappoint.  I was surprised to not see any reviews of this business, so I wanted to take a minute to speak of my experience with him and extend my strongest recommendation to my neighbors in Baldwin County and Mobile County and to thank Barry and his wife again for everything they have done for us over the last two decades.

He was very knowledgeable and communicated to me everything he was doing and why. He explained tests that he was performing and what should be expected while performing such tests. Long story even longer, he replaced the unit. Was upfront about all that would be needed and to prevent just doing patch work where we'd be needing future services other than prevention. He did the work in a very timely manner. He has followed up by calling to make sure everything was well and to answer any questions if there were any. He made a somewhat costly experience a very smooth and effortless one. We have not had ANY problems at all, but I'm sure if we did, he'd be right there. I HIGHLY recommend him.

I highly recommend Seth and Alabama Air and probably wouldn't use anyone else.",

But they will be happy to reschedule this service for Monday the next week.\nI had several companies offering service the day after I confirmed Sears service, that was a BIG MISTAKE.

While they were there working, my husband heard a loud pop and our smart thermostat quit working. They did purchase a new thermostat, but refused to install it.  My husband had to follow the technician to Lowe's and the tech left straight from there.  When we went to install it, no power was coming back from the thermostat.  While we fought it out with our home warranty company, we were left without heat for a week in below freezing temperatures.  They finally sent a tech from another company.  The technician had shorted a fuse in the unit, our thermostat and thermostat backplate, and the circuit breaker looked like it had almost caught fire.  Two years prior, when repairing our microwave, they broke the fan hood and then denied it.  Avoid Sears repair at all cost!!",

One Hour Heating and Cooling came out and told me I needed to spend thousands of dollars and replace my entire system.  Durham Heating and Air came out, and although they were helpful they still didn't fix our problem and I had to pay for 3 service visits over the course of a little over a month.\n\nThen I did what I should have done to start with and called All American Comfort Consultants.  Dave came out to our house and mysteriously our A/C started working again before he arrived.  He examined the system and said that there was no way he could definitively say what the problem was, but he suspected it was a relay in the system and to call him if it shut off again.  Since he couldn't find a problem, he said I owed him nothing.\n\nA week or two later and our AC shut off yet again, by this time it was 6:30 at night, I figured I was out of luck but I called Dave and he told me he could be at my house in about 45 minutes.  He arrived on time and within 10 minutes had found the problem and it was indeed a relay.  He had the replacement part with him and replaced it.  Now my AC has worked perfectly ever since he fixed it.\n\nI highly recommend All American Comfort Consultants, they put customers first and strive hard to ensure you are satisfied.",

He arrived super fast (20 minutes), was professional, and even understood to be quiet in the house and attic as we have two little ones asleep.

There are numerous hot zones, like walk in closets and  raised ceilings inbetween non insulated areas that are making my system over work. The vents in the bonus room weren’t planned are all eye level across the wall making the wall unusable for dressers, beds etc. I inquired about upgrading to a Nest Thermostat and was quoted at $1100 it’s a $250 thermostat that is simple to install, so I chose to just change them myself. I found out why they charge so much they have their name printed on the thermostats they use.  The ducts for the returns weren’t connected properly, my building supervisor had to retape them. The carrier units they chose are decent, but their drain lines were put in the improper place. The ducts were all strapped in the attic that as the one good thing about them.",

  "text": "Use Rollins A/C service at your own peril, called, asked them to come out to fix my air conditioner, their \"technician\" (grandson of owner) , said it just needed a recharge, put 3lbs of freon in it, charged us $30 per pound + $95 service call, was here for about 20 minutes, told us to have a nice day and to call again if we had any more problems. A/C worked for approximately 36 hours, and promptly quit and returned to the previous state (broken). Called back, was told they would be happy to come back out and charge us another $95 bucks + any more freon etc..., I called back to discuss the confusion, was told to \"go to hell\" by Mr. Rollins himself, and was hung up on. Now I know this happens to many people around the world everyday and me and my family are nothing special but I just have to point this out as a glaring example, I just retired from the U.S. Army after 20+ years, held a combat MOS the entire time, served in 3 separate wars, and 6 12 month combat deployments, with the last one being 18 months, and I really thought that I would return to a grateful nation, I'm not trying to say we are better than any other proud American, but, I would have at the very least, expected not to be treated as a 3rd class citizen. Nobody deserves to be treated this way, and maybe $200 dollars is not very much money to some people, but it is to us. I am sure my brothers and sisters in arms can agree with me on that point. Sorry for the rant, but I just needed to say something to someone and maybe at least warn some good people before it happens to them.",

  "text": "Speedy, reliable, excellent customer service. The frigid temperatures in December were made worse when the unit in our office building broke. It was hard for us to find anyone who could fix it. After making a few calls with no one able to help from the list we had, a friend told me about Berryhill Services. With not much choice, we contacted them and it was the perfect move. Not only did they show up quickly, but also had us up and running in no time which was difficult it being so close to Christmas. I hate to have posted this late, but with us moving to a new building that needs a/c completely redone, I thought of you, and remembered I planned on doing this late December. Thank you for an excellent job and I can't wait to see what fine work you do for us in our new building.\nA.J./T.H.",

They arrived on time every single day and were very respectful of our time and our privacy. I was worried it would be difficult having a crew in our home everyday for 5 weeks but they made it a great experience.\nThey did a complete remodel of our Master Suite, from top to bottom.\nRemoved popcorn ceiling, removed old flooring and installed LVP. Removed jacuzzi tub for stand alone tub. Lowered walls to open up room. Removed shower stall and gave us a gorgeous walk in shower. We absolutely love it! Painted our existing vanity cabinets and added granite tops. All new lighting, fans and mirrors. Their work is top notch.\nThen there are the sub-contractors.\nWe met each one as they came into our home. They they were all very easy to work with and made sure we understood everything they were doing.\nWe definitely made the right choice.",

My last text to him was \"I'll be sure to do a review\". He read the text and responded \"If we can make this right please allow us we been super super busy\".  Even after that he did not reach out to see what could be done to make it right, I haven't heard from him again. Making it right would have been to simply come out and get paid for the service. I understand being busy but I don't understand if this is a business,  why no response.  The only reason I got a reply is because I said I was doing a review.

  "text": "Recently contacted Morrow Heating and Air due to my current HVAC unit being about 19 years old and unable to keep up. I had several questions going in to it as this is all new to me.\n\nThe team took the time to make sure all of my questions were addressed in a way that I could easily understand. The team recommended a few different options at different price points, discussed the pros and cons of each and let me make the decisions.\n\nFast forward to the install day, Morrow Heating and Air showed up when promised, ready to work. A few hours later I am up and running with a super efficient, new unit. The install was super clean and no short cuts were taken. The advantages of the new unit were explained, the thermostat operation was also covered. The team made sure all of my questions were addressed before double checking everything and completing the job.\n\nOverall, the level of knowledge and work provided went above and beyond other HVAC contractors I’ve worked with in the past. I would not hesitate to use the guys at Morrow Heating and Air again!",

I told him we we needed 50 sheets of half inch OSB. He said a lift has 69 pieces on it. And that they would start unloading 19 pieces so when we finish shopping, they were ready to load. We got a few of the things we needed in the store and went to the commercial checkout. I didn’t catch the lady’s name that check this out, but she was very nice and helpful. As soon as I paid for everything, they had us pull through with our trailer and loaded this up immediately very professionally. Very impressed with Rick and his associate that loaded us. Thank you all very much for getting us on the road very quickly. Very nice to see attentive associates.",

Upon arrival it was found, you in fact did have an issue with your heating element again, however your invoice could not be located for warranty purposes. When your husband could provide no invoice, check or credit card charge, our office looked into the PREVIOUS year’s records and found the original invoice. It was also stated on the invoice that the vent system for the house must be properly cleaned and it was explained to you if it wasn’t cleaned your dryer and any replacement parts and or additional parts would continue to fail prematurely. You not only have left an inaccurate review but also tried to take advantage of a situation.",

I called early Tuesday afternoon (after a Memorial Day weekend) to schedule an appointment, expecting to get an appointment setup for later in the week or even the following week. Instead I received a call from their Dispatcher letting me know a Service Technician was available that same day!\nThe Service Tech, Shantan, was the best. He looked at my issue (leaky faucet) and gave me a quote to complete the repair that same day. The pricing was reasonable, and Shantan went out of his way to ensure the problem was resolved before leaving. We had some issues with parts (thanks Lowe's), which required Shantan to complete several trips for parts to complete the job, but he stuck it out and made sure the problem was resolved despite it taking longer than either of us expected.\nI cannot say enough good things about Shantan, or the service I received from Fuller. Everyone I worked with goes above and beyond to ensure the work is completed to your satisfaction and I can attest that they've gained a customer after this experience!",

Even though this would result in a more difficult installation for him and his team, he went the extra mile to make sure our utility bills would remain as low as possible once the job was complete. We had an extra large bonus room addition separated by a cinder block wall in my crawl space that no other contractor said could be reached, but Scott’s team were able to run punch out a small opening and get two vents to that room.

  "text": "We recently had some trouble with our central unit.  The problem didn't require a service call because I was able to do most of the repair.  However, I did call Cash heating and cooling and spoke with Josh and he was awesome.  He made several phone calls for me and got me in touch with the right company for parts.  This didn't make him a dime!  That is why I'm writing this review... if Josh hadn't helped me when no one else would I would still be trying to find parts on internet! That is proof to me that Cash heating and cooling is focused on helping customers even when it doesn't pay!  I will definitely be using them in future and you should to!",

We called Jackie who showed up with his team to troubleshoot AND fix the problem.  They even offered advice on an unrelated HVAC issue that ended up SAVING us $$$.

  "text": "I would look elsewhere for your AC repair needs.  I utilized this company recently to install a new thermostat and perform standard maintenance on my home unit.  The service technician was nice and appeared knowledgable.  While conducting inspection the service tech informed me that my fan time delay relay switch was faulty and would need to be replaced and forewarned me that because my unit is a Trane that parts could be very expensive, I intially did not give it a second thought and told him to do whatever it just needed to be fixed.  He called the owner and quoted me $230 for the relay switch, he returned a few days later to install the switch.  To keep this long story short after reviewing my invoice, I called a few other places and the replacement relay switch is actually $40 (after mark-up).  When I confronted the owner about the $230 vs. $40 difference he tried to lie about it.  I only agreed to pay $50 for the part and went my separate way but I wanted to put this review out so hopefully others in my area don't get scammed.  I understand people need to make money and parts are almost always marked up but this was blantant price gouging $40 vs $230 is a HUGE difference.  I would recommend checking prices on replacment parts and requesting part #'s or they will try and take advantage of you.  BEWARE!",

I have a home warranty company that called them to my home to fix some ducts that fell and were cooling my crawl space instead of my home. They are 56 years old. It's bound to happen. Well, because I had cable installed three months ago, Charlie told them that the cable guy must have knocked the ducts loose and that's why they fell. This is a flat out lie. You cannot prove that someone knocked them down unless you saw them do it. Believe me I would have called a long time ago if that was the case.There is other duct work that has fallen nowhere near where the cables were installed, but those won't be covered either because it's all the same system.  The ducts fell only in the last week or so. Charlie was never at my home to do the inspection and the person who was at my home said that it was due to old age. But because Charlie said otherwise only looking at pictures, my home warranty company will not be covering the cost. Now I will have to hire someone on my own, and you bet it will not be One Call. Not to mention their prices are much higher than most anyway.",

Angel and the  office staff were fantastic and Ben McDill (Service Tech) came byon Tuesday and checked my system out. Due to the age of the system and estimated repair costs, I decided to buy a new system. Ben got all the information and measurements and called the office and came up with a very reasonable quote for a new system. Ben came back yesterday morning and removed the old system and got everything ready to install the new system. A little later Travis Carden and Steven Davis (install Techs) came by and by the end of the day had a new Heil Unit (with 48 month free financing and a 10 year warranty) was installed and working.\nI would recommend Jolly Heating and Air for all of your AC needs.",

He basically just performed a quick service call and ghosted me afterwards. His only recommendation was to use a less restrictive filter. This 10 minutes of advice cost me $115.00\n\nI then called a young man from Pell City that owned an HVAC company. He looked inside the unit and discovered that a piece of insulation was causing loud noises in the unit.\n\nI figured Pete would have discovered the real issue on his first visit with his years of experience but I guess that was too much work.",

I called Brian, and he was at my house within 15 minutes. He reviewed our situation, thoroughly checked our equipment, and explained to us that the problem was actually with the local power company. His assessment of the problem was correct.  My husband and I feared that calling an electrician could result in high costs/expenses and not calling an electrician could result in fire or dangers to our family. Because we didn't understand the problem, we could easily be taken advantage of. Brian alleviated those fears. He clearly intends to help others. He even showed us that we had a wire socket ready for a generator, if we were to buy one, that we did not know we had. Praise God for people like Brian.",

There was small flies coming out of the drain in the front shower bathroom. Rick would not return our calls so we called another company. Come to find out he did the plumbing all wrong and not to code. He used the wrong size pipes under the garbage disposal and all the food and water was going under the house into the crawl space. 3000 dollars later we got the work corrected.\nYou might be questioning why I am posting this now.\nWe just ran into someone who recently had a horrible experience with Rick and I thought I would share my experience so others would not fall into the same trap.",

So angry thought he would have a heart attack in driveway\nLooking for new company to fix his errors nowand having to potentially file.  Avoid at all costs.\nUPDATE 1-31-20\nWe have spoken with the Rheem manufacturers and they are sending out the part to fix the issue. We did troubleshooting over the phone, temped the water, and worked through the basic repairs, and he confirmed the issue. Gas control valve I believe although that may be incorrect. I didn't write down what he called it. When I describe the story that we dealt with with Mr Wilbanks they were surprised and not happy. They said the issue is a common issue and is seen in approximately 90% of complaints that had the problems we were having with the water heater. The representative said for Mr Wilbanks not to address it either he A. had no interest in fixing the problem or B. was completely ignorant to basic repairs for that water heater. Either way the service was terrible and he did not do the job as he should. Additionally the way he handled himself was unacceptable and like I said our family believes he did his best to take advantage of our 96 year old grandmother. Please avoid this man at all costs\n\nSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.",

  "text": "I had Mr. Holcomb and his crew work on my bathroom. Here are the issues I had with this contractor: it took him nearly 40 days to get to the job, after I gave him over half of the money to \"get to the job\" and numerous calls to see when he would start \"; upon completion of the job, he relayed it is all finished and I mailed him a check for the remainder of the amount as per what his contract and verbal discussions agreed to; being as this is a rental property I assumed (bad bad bad) all was good after talking to him (Holcomb) and my tenant. . .upon arrival at my property, I saw a job that was half way properly done. . staples half way in the wood, framing boards ripped and not painted (thus allowing water to touch and will rot) framing / overlap pieces cut too short and one piece not even going from ceiling to floor leaving at least 6 inches of a gap and probably the biggest item, no caulking used on the tub / shower at the top and bottom of the unit. Folks I could go on with the list of discrepancies but if you are using him, I suggest you are there to watch and ensure your points you have agreed and paid for are met to your approval.  In closing, I will be filing a complaint against him via the BBB. It is a shame that I have paid thousands for such a bad / poorly job when he came highly recommended. Update 22 May I rec'd notification from BBB and they said Mr. Holcomb did not respond to the calls or letters they sent. I asked BBB what could be done now and they relayed it would have to go to court. So in short, if you have an issue with a \"provider of a service\" and expect the BBB to do anything, well perhaps it will work for you and secondly, Mr. Holcomb I do hope that you treat future clients (if you get any) better than you did me on the job I paid you for. People, beware.",

It is a mansard style home, where the attic is very low, approximately 4 ft at the peak. We talked about proper R-value and getting the insulation behind and under framing and ductwork. They showed up as scheduled, did a great job. Would definitely use them again.",

We called them after getting several estimates from other local companies. They beat them in price by thousands of  dollars. We had a picture of what needed replacing, he gave us a quote and did not go one penny over what he quoted us for. In fact, he told us if the cost went over the quoted amount he would cover it. And he did! These men treated our home and us with so much respect, did not leave a mess of any kind to be cleaned up. After the job was complete, he told us if by any chance that we had more problems he would come and keep filling it with Freon for no charge until it was fixed. This young man knows what he’s doing! He came, did maybe 2 hours of work, and we have not had the first hiccup in his work! I am so thankful for this company, I have told so many people about them.

I reached out through text, email and the company website correspondence and still no answer from him! It’s so bad that he read my text and never responded to it! The website says 24/7 services available but he didn’t even answer me back! Now I had some issues with him when doing my install and duck work but we still used him because it was already paid for. I won’t recommend this company to ANYONE at all. Very unprofessional and he thinks he can talk to you anyway once he has your money! Now my unit outside stopped working and I called and texted all day from my number and different numbers but no answer! I had to end up getting another company to come out and fix the problem that only took 10 minutes to fix! I definitely want my money refunded from this company because like I said I HAVE A 10 YEAR WARRANTY! Don’t and I mean DO NOT use this company for anything because you will end up like me!",

I looked the company up on line and called and text the only number listed for the company, no answer, and my text just inquired if it was ,in fact , delta heating and ac... the only response I got multiple times was who is this? It is was a yes or no question but he refused to answer. I text that I had an ac unit he had installed ....  to which he replied \"this is Chris, I just work for delta\" ( weird his name and number are the only contact info that one can find on the business... (and I later learned that he is the owner, but in definitely see why he wouldn't claim to own it!  ). I then sent a couple more texts detailing the issue we were having with the unit and that it was under warranty.!! No response although the messages were being delivered..... until they werent... Chris blocked me!!! And I was forced to have another company come out and do the repairs.... and I wasn't surprised to learn that they had been picking up lots of jobs from others just like me, people whom Chris chose to ignore and not honor warranties they had felt would be beneficial if something happened to their big purchase of things such as ac units and or furnaces ....  upon reading other google reviews it is apparent this is how Chris Guy does business regularly, and he is earning a well deserved reputation of a poor excuse of a businessman and someone not to be trusted !! I will never recommend Chris Guys business or work to anyone.  Someone should call the better business bureau on this man!",

Recently we discovered our heat pump was damaged and blowing breakers, sadly it was too old to efficiently repair, Chris got us a whole brand new system, completely replaced, with terms we could afford and within about 48 hours. I will always recommend Chris and Delta, they are the only resource you'll need to warm up and keep your cool in southern Alabama.",

A professional technician (Johnathon) looked over our unit and advised us of our problem.  Our 1984 unit was hopeless.  The entire system needed to be replaced.  Andre LaConsay immediately came out and reviewed the situation.  He figured out how to make modifications to improve the new system so it would be more efficient.  In two days a tremendous amount of work was done so we would have our new unit up and working.  They left us with an ac window unit for the one night that we didn't have air.  Great job, professional, and done the right way.  Thank you Johnathon & Derrek for all your hard work.  Ed & Renee Croft",

  "text": "Excellent service from my initial call to the repair completion!  Mr. Brad Hackabee was our service provider, and he was outstanding! I received a call within fifteen minutes from Mr. Huckabee after talking with the main officeto explain that our heating unit was not working properly. It was mid afternoon on 1/2/25 when I called Crager Heating and Air to schedule a service appointment.  I anticipated it would be several days before anyone would be able to come and check to see what the problem was with our heating unit. To my complete surprise Mr. Huckabee offered to come out later that afternoon once he completed the repair appointments he already had scheduled for the day. I consider that being willing to go above and beyond for the customer. His willingness to add another repair appointment to his already full workday was comendable and speaks volumes about his dedication to his job and the customers he works with. Since it was so late in the day I told him to let's just schedule for today. We set an appointment time of 8 a.m. on 1/3/25. Mr. Huckabee called when he was on his way and he arrived on time. I explained the issue we were having with our heating unit and he immediately went to work, determined the problem, explained to me the issue and the options available to repair the problem and the cost associated with each option. Prior to talking with me about the needed repair Mr. Huckabee had already called to see if the needed parts were available so he would be able to tell me when the repairs could be completed. Once I decided on the repair option Mr. Huckabee went and got the needed parts, returned to my house and completed the repair. I would like to thank Crager  Heating and Air and Mr. Brad Huckabee for their excellent work and customer service!",

Throughout the service, he was punctual, respectful of my home, and made sure to leave the work area clean.\n\nWhat stood out most was his commitment to customer satisfaction. Donald went above and beyond, ensuring that I was fully informed about my options and providing recommendations tailored to my needs. It’s rare to find a technician who combines technical skill with such genuine care for the customer experience.\n\nThanks to Donald, my AC system is running smoothly, and I feel confident that any future issues will be promptly addressed.

He has been working for us for going on 4 years now and he does a phenomenal job every time he shows up. When he says he'll be there he will! He's easy to work with and gets the job done. We have gotten both a central AC and a split shot installed by him in the past and he been very dependable with answering any questions we have regarding both units. Last summer we had to call him because our central AC kept freezing over and he was there within two hours tops! The AC had a clog in one of the pipes and instead replacing that piece and calling it a day, Cody replaced it AND cleaned our entire unit!",

  "text": "TL;DR: technician installed a breaker not up to code on a warranty call and lied to me and the supervisor.\n\nWe scheduled an appointment for Strada Electrical to come out last Friday for a breaker that started randomly tripping overnight between 3 and 7 AM.\nThe technician arrived but called and texted the wrong number and instead of knocking on the door to see if I was home, decided to just leave a note saying he waited and I would have to reschedule. I immediately called and complained about him saying he texted and called but never actually knocked or anything (our camera picked him up dropping off the door hanger and leaving).\nThe company said they would send another guy out later that day. He came out and spent about 10 minutes at the house checking the outlets. He gave me his number and said to call him if it kept happening and he would come out then.\nIt continued happening but he was too busy to come back during the work day. The only times he asked if he could come out was Sunday \"after church\" and Monday night at 7:30 pm. I told him I'd rather him come during the week and told him it was too late that day respectively..\nHe did come out Wednesday morning after I let him know it went out again. He spent a few minutes here and said he replaced the breaker with a bigger breaker and it should fix the issue. I let my husband know what they did and thankfully he had a question about it. He researched that solution and looked at the breaker when he got home that day.\n\nTurns out the tech that came out Removed theGFCI/AFCI breaker and replaced it with an $8 breaker that had no fault protection on it. This was for an indoor space that did not have any GFCI outlets in the space. This is not up to code. His \"fix\" was to put our house at risk just to be done with us.\nAfter speaking with the supervisor, we found out that the tech had not communicated any of this to him as he was under the impression it had been resolved at the first visit.  We were told that \"he talked to the tech and he actually installed an AFCI breaker, not a larger breaker.\" My husband had to send the supervisor a picture of the breaker for him to see that it was NOT an AFCI.\n\nThe supervisor came out the next morning (Thursday morning) and replaced the breaker with an AFCI breaker.\n\nI appreciate that they have tried to make it right, but the tech still has his job and the concern now is that the company is accepting the fact that he knowingly installed a breaker that was not up to code.. and if my husband hadn't questioned the solution, we would not have known the wiser. We would currently have a breaker box not up to code and who knows what could have happened if we did have an actual Arc issue (or similar).\n\nAll I'm saying is that the if you use them or have used them, double check all their work because there is no telling what work was actually done.",

When the issue was recently discovered, Scott Wiley tracked down the problem, admitted the error, and stood behind the product, eating the cost of the replacement part. He could have told me to pound sand and I would have been SOL. But he doesn't operate like that. I doubt it would have even crossed his mind. Scott is an honest tradesman.

  "text": "Special order door.  I was told it would be in within 4 weeks.  After that time had passed, I went into the store to find out when the door would be in and to pay for the installation.  At the millworks counter, I was told that I couldn't order a door and then pay for the installation deposit and that the door must be \"measured\" first. I explained that at the time the order was placed, we had not decided who would install the door but my husband had measured for the replacement door. The employees left me standing at the counter and walked away.\n\nI then took my concerns to the assistant manager and they genuinely tried to find out where the door was and when it would be available.  Since it was late Friday afternoon, someone would contact me first thing Monday morning I was told.  They also said that the manufacturer of the door had not requested permission to deliver yet?? I paid the $50 required for someone to come \"measure\" the already ordered door.  I waited until Thursday of that next week and spoke with Chad, a store manager, who agreed that my transaction had been \"difficult.\" Chad said that Steven, the millworks manager, would call me the following Monday and let me know that the door had indeed been delivered to the store.\nOn Thursday of that week (now 3 weeks after promised date), Steven called and said he had been trying to reach me since Monday but my number in their computer was an old number. I had given Home Depot my new phone number a minimum of THREE times already.  I paid for the rest of the installation by credit card over the phone and was told that the installation company would call me for the install date.  They called immediately and we set up for the Friday morning of the next week.  When that day came, the installation company called and said they could not deliver the door because it was storming.  I reminded them that this was a STEEL door that would lead from an enclosed garage into the house.  They told me they could not deliver the door in the \"storm\" or anytime that day.  Please note that my high school age granddaughter played soccer that same day locally.  They rescheduled for the next Tuesday, which had now been 71/2 weeks since the initial order.\nThe installer came yesterday with the WRONG door!   I'm OVER dealing with Home Depot about this door, deciding to just keep it because of ALL THE HASSEL I've experienced. However,  the independent installer was very polite and professional and definitely the BEST experience about this purchase.\nTrying to do business with Home Depot is not worth the frustration this caused.",

  "text": "I own a small business  in Spanish Fort AL. We were  scheduled  to have carpet installed on Saturday June 2. The \"certified carpet technician\" you sent was Alexander Spruill.  I spent all night the Friday before clearing out the dining room and ripping up the carpet to get the area ready for installation. There was a 7' X 141/2' area that had tile. We wanted to carpet that area. I asked about the transition when the floor was first measured. I was told that it could be floated out with no problem. When your \"technician\" arrived he immediately informed me that he did not have the materials or tools to float out the transition. I told him I would go get whatever he needs.  He then stated that he did not have the time to do that on that day. I asked if I pulled up the tile would he be able to do it then and he informed me that he had a baseball game to go to. I asked when he could get it done and he said he could float out the floor on Monday and lay the carpet on Tuesday. I told him that was not an option, as my business needed to be opened on Monday.He shrugged his shoulders and left. I then realized the carpet we paid for was in the back of his van and I ran out to catch him before he left with it. He told me he could not leave it there but he could take it to Home Depot. I followed him to Home Depot. We tried to get a manager to help resolve the problem but he was in a hurry to leave and did so before the manager was able to do anything. All I heard form your \"certified carpet technician\" was \"No.\" and \"I can't.\" I am a small business and I believe in customer service. Mr. Spruill had absolutely no professionalism and did not care at all if the job got done so that my business could reopen as scheduled. I shall now spend the rest of the week on the internet relaying my bad experience to other consumers.\n-Mitch Murphy\np.s. It took me until midnight, but I got the carpet laid by myself.",

I am thrilled that Jason and his team did an outstanding job on all of these projects!\n\nFirstly, the final product of the fence work was absolutely beautiful. They paid close attention to detail and ensured everything was done to our specifications.\n\nThe water-damaged flooring was expertly repaired and blended seamlessly with the surrounding floor. The painting was flawless, and the new siding repairs fit nicely into the existing siding. The kitchen backsplash tile was also installed perfectly, and the quartz countertops brought our kitchen to a whole new level.\n\nJason and his team were reliable and professional throughout the process. They were always available to answer our questions or concerns, and they completed the work on schedule and within budget.\n\nOverall, I could not be happier with Jason and Integrity Maintenance! They truly went above and beyond to ensure that everything was done to our satisfaction, and the result is a beautiful, functional, and updated home. I highly recommend this contractor to anyone looking for excellent home improvement work.",

We set a time for them to come look at my unit and he and his dad Spud were there on time (a nice change from the usual repair people). They assessed the problem and got back to me pretty quickly with the cost of replacing my AC/heat pump which was more then fair and much better then the other quotes I had received. They were back out a couple days later and replaced my unit, thermostat, cleaned my dryer vents, and many other things going above and beyond.  They were great at communicating with me during every step. I would HIGHLY recommend these men Tristen and Spud with ALWAYS COMFORTABLE HEATING AND COOLING IN HAZEL GREEN! Thanks guys!

  "text": "I saw a post on Facebook from Shields Heating and Air to get your A/C checked before the summer heat  arrives. That sounded like a good idea since I had to have freon put in at the end of summer last year, and wanted to see if everything was still good. Come to find out, not only was it very low on freon again, there was a leak in the coils outside. Tommy Shields, the owner, came out and sat down with the wife and I to deliver the bad news. It was not what we wanted to hear, but realised it had to be fixed, or we were going to be really uncomfortable in this house once the higher temperatures arrived. Speaking with Tommy, you get the vibes this is a man of faith and integrity. He shot straight with us, recommended a soultion, explained the benefit to implementing his recommendation, answered all of our questions and ended with giving us a very competitive price that was surprisingly affordable. The wife and I put our trust in Tommy and hired him to replace our system, and boy am I glad we did. He and his crew arrived early and finished ahead of schedule. They were very thorough. The work was neat and clean. Plus,  the clean up was so spectacular, that you couldn't tell anyone was here. The unit they put in was state of the art technology, super efficient, and better than I expected. He also had the best warranty.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in need of a HVAC company, I can't say enough good about Shields Heat & Air. They are honest and hard working, and get 5-Stars from me. Give local business owner Tommy Shields a call. You will be glad you did.",

STAY AWAY FROM “HUNTSVILLE CAPITAL GROUP”. Nothing but a front! Supposedly a “home renovator” that flips houses but everybody you talk to about her tells you to run away as fast as you can and steer clear of her and her husband. She has 2 other confirmed legal cases going on against her from her general contractor that she ripped off with non payment as well. The only reason her negative review was left is because she was served legal papers for a law suit that she knows she doesn’t have a leg to stand on. She pretends she likes everything and is so pleased until it’s time to pay and then she has a problem and refuses to pay. There is absolutely no pleasing this lady, even being out a dozen plus times doing what she asks. She is a professional con-artist and just wants a free job WITHOUT PAYING. SHE IS FAR FROM A DISABLED “grandmother”. She always has a “poor pitiful her” excuse. ALWAYS. As far as I’m concerned, she still owes Tennessee Valley thousand of dollars, SHE NEVER EVER PAID MORE THAN HALF FOR THE WORK OR MATERIALS THAT WERE FINISHED AND PROVIDED",

Production Manager Kyle Hamby and his Servpro crews arrived within twenty minutes of our initial distress call.  Kyle carefully surveyed the damage, explained to us what damage had occurred (some was not visible), described to us what our options were, and set into motion the best plan for our particular situation.  Throughout the day Kyle monitored the crews, with Theresa Smith of Marketing & Advertising dropping in to check on progress.  In the following days, Kyle and his technicians ran dehumidifiers and fans while continuing to monitor moisture levels until we were out of the woods!  If not for Servpro’s quick response time and incredible communication, we would have lost valuable hours being closed to the public.  All in all, we only opened late one day, and that was by two hours!  Thank you Servpro!",

He really put the work in to figure out what was wrong and managed to fix it without even having to order a new part! He explained everything in detail and I’ve never felt better about working with a technician. Some other great things about Integrity Services, in general:\n\n#1 Scheduling an appointment was a breeze and the lady I spoke with on the phone was so nice!\n#2 They were ON TIME and super polite in both of the appointments I’ve made with them. (Dryer vent cleaning and HVAC tune-up.) Texted before they showed up and called once they got there.\n#3 Another technician stopped by to help Andy on his way home. It’s nice to see they’re not run down and unwilling to lend a hand to their coworkers. Plus I felt like I got twice the expertise for the same price!\n\nIt’s nice to feel like you’ve found a company that will be reliable when things go wrong in your home and wont try to up-sell you at every chance.

However, the AC behaved the same. It still didn't feel cold enough. It took the AC a few hours to drop 1 degree and overnight to cool a few more degrees.

Since replacing our system, power bills have gone down, efficiency has gone up, and our comfort in the home has been restored. We have a 3,600-square-foot home, and our power bill is the same as it was in our previous 2,400-square-foot home. That is genuinely remarkable. In addition, Mr. Gossett is a kind and ethical human being, and I know more painfully than most that this is not always the case... you will not find a more intelligent, competent, or ethical contractor.",

  "text": "Initially I didn’t have any complaints with the company. I was referred to Alapro for my basement due to it having water damage. We made first contact April 2024. Before the insurance adjuster came to my home the company cleaned up and broke down everything and gave the insurance company their findings. Luckily my insurance company accepted their allegations. Throughout this time Alapro would come to the home once or twice a week to fix my basement. My insurance paid out over 12000.00 to fix my basement. After the basement was 90% complete the project manager requested another 5000.00 from my insurance company!  Each time before each job was complete he would ask for a the payment or half of what the insurance company sent. After calculating up the cost for materials it appeared that there should have been at least 2000.00 or more left over on from what my insurance paid out. After inquiring about where the extra money was at Mr.Phillip (the project manager) continued to tell me we would sit down and talk about where the extra money went but each time he would schedule a time he would never show up. Him not showing up turned into him no longer answering my calls. As I said previously the company first started working on my basement April 2024 the basement wasn’t complete until August 2024. I use the term “complete” loosely because some of the things I asked for were never replaced. I picked out a vanity and the vanity doesn’t have knobs for the doors! Not sure if they were misplaced by the company or they just didn’t want to put them on. I even have an extra hole in my ceiling that wasn’t their before. I wouldn’t recommend them if you like to know where your money is going and if you want a project done timely. However if you want someone to completely handle the insurance process for you and help put a little extra money in their pockets I say go for it!",

Steve stopped by and walked around my house ask me a few questions and said he would get back to me with an estimate. When he texted me the amount he could do it for I ask him when he could do it and he said he would let me know. At that time I went ahead and called the LP company  to come pick up their tank thinking R&S would complete their quote within a few weeks. After waiting to hear from him for almost a month I attempted to call but got no answer on his cell phone nor did he return any of my phone calls. I would expect more from a company especially when dealing with one of the owners. Now I have no heat in my home with Winter coming and children to keep warm.

Steve provided a date that he would arrive to my house to give the estimate, although was 3 days late. After the estimate was provided, which was fair, he advised what date and time frame he would have the materials to arrive to complete the job. I had a newborn on the way and he was aware that I needed the unit as soon as possible. Steve did not show up on the date the unit was to be installed; there was no call to alert me that he would not show up. I called multiple times since then and left messages with no return call or explanation. This is very bad business.  I had put multiple other things on hold to ensure my house was prepared for the arrival of my new baby. It has now been 3 weeks with no word from this company. I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and give this company time to make things right or provide a logical explanation, but have not been provided either of these things.  I would not recommend this company for your HVAC needs, as they are not reliable to get the job done.",

It will not output cold air at all, nor will it output heat.\n\nLast year, I called him and asked that he come see me sometime that week, and he said that he would come check on it. Me and my dad stay at home, as he is disabled, and so we both knew we would be there for that week (And even the week after that.) in the event that he showed up, and he never did. Ontop of that, he claimed he had come by the house when we finally got ahold of him again (A month later). Excuse me? I'm sitting here with my disabled father with no car to go anywhere during the day and you're going to try to tell me that you came by and we had all vanished?\n\nThis year (2017) he did the exact same thing. He said he would be here \"This Tuesday or Wednesday.\" And now, sitting here a full week later and having not got a call explaining why they havn't come by, I'm very very upset. This is two years that we have went without AC due to their laziness.\n\nWhats worse is, when he DID service our AC some years prior (I think it was about 5-6 years ago) it actually broke a few days later and he wouldn't come back to fix it, and this was after him telling us that he would be back in a week to make sure everything was running.\n\nThis is the worst Company i've ever seen. They promise to come out to your house and fix your AC, but then you never see them and then they lie to your face.",

  "text": "Very pleased with the service from Southern Valley Services reference radon mitigation. Knowing from my own monitoring that the radon levels in my home were too high, I started soliciting quotes from several companies. Southern Valley was the ONLY company which actually sent a representative out to look at the project.  All of the other contractors without exception quoted me over the telephone or via email.\n\nSouthern Valley Services sent rep David Fletcher out to look at the project. His inspection along with his knowledge and experience identified additional issues that I should be aware of in the crawl space. These were issues unknown to the contractors who quoted me over the telephone or through email. I thank David for the education.\n\nFrom there it was the small details which sealed my satisfaction. One of those details was responsive communication. Another detail was that Southern Valley was the only vendor willing to put the exhaust pipe through the roof rather than have it be an eyesore on the exterior wall of the house. In fairness to another vendor I did not go with, that vendor offered the roof penetration at an additional cost in some areas, but for whatever reason, they wouldn’t do it due to my location.\n\nIn closing, Southern Valley Services, represented by David Fletcher, provided great service, fantastic communication, a professional installation, the best price of the vendors I shopped and installed an effective system. The radon levels which recently have been between 7.0 to 10.5 have no risen above 1.60 since the system went in.\n\nUse Southern Valley Services. You will not regret going with them.",

Tommy has been very good about maintaining email contact with me and had always phoned to let me know what was going on. I got my TVA rebate and the effects of the new insulation are very noticeable. My house maintains a very stable temperature.\n\nThere was an issue with the insulation installation that I didn't know about until six months later; however, Tommy's willingness to make it right earns his company a five star review. The two techs that serviced my house filled my AC drain pan with insulation which caused the drain line to clog, eventually leading to condensation leaking onto my ceiling. They have since been let go. Tommy is going to pay for the repairs on my ceiling.\n\nI recommend Southern Valley Services for your insulation needs.",

Now my AC continues to not work and he said in order for him to come back I would have to finally another claim, the warranty company I verified twice said I did not have to. Each time I had talked to him he had an attitude the entire time. I did something he recommended yet I did it wrong but he failed to provide clear details most likely due to his attitude.

So they had to order the coil and they came back in a few days and replaced it and added quite a bit of Freon.  The total cost was $1600.  Well, a few months later, As the weather started getting colder, we started turning on our heater.  Well, the Outside unit started making a loud wailing sound.  Attempted to contact McCollum and nothing, won't answer the phone, won't return messages.  I contacted another company referred by a friend.  He came and inspected the system and he found out the coil installed was for a 3-ton system. Ours is a 4-ton system so it was basically getting choked out. He recommended that we call McCollum so they could fix their error. Again, tried contacting him and again NOTHING. We had to have the system replaced due to damage caused by the wrong coil being installed by McCollum.  Stay away from them as they are not an honest company nor do they back their work",

  "text": "We have used MPE several times for plumbing and electrical and they have been great. Very professional and courteous staff and even though we are pretty far away from them, they provide quick service. Today we had to call them for leaking faucet on our second floor, and they were here a couple hours later and quickly fixed the leak. They also went well beyond what was required and called another company to coordinate the repair of the water damage. Can not recommend them more. Great company and excellent staff. Only wish they worked with American Home Shield so we could use them for home warranty repairs. We end up calling MPE because we can’t wait two weeks for service through AHS as they hunt for service companies close enough to us (no plumbers).",

We had to go buy a cable adapter to hook it up to the cable cover. They had no junction box in the wall and wrapped the back of the plug with electrical tape next to the 2x4 they chopped up instead of putting a junction box in the wall, which are made to go over a 2x4. It looked like it was chopped up with a crowbar or hatchet. Then they were called to come back to fix it and put in a junction box, but it's still so crooked and close together that we cant get covers over both outlets.\nI wish this would let me post a picture but it will not.

  "text": "I had a disappointing experience with this cooling and heating company. They charged excessively high prices for their services, which were far beyond what was reasonable. To make matters worse, they completed the work without consulting me first of a change, leading to a significant overcharge. I have heard similar complaints from others about this company, which indicates a troubling pattern of overcharging and lack of transparency. While I understand that expertise and time are valuable, it's unacceptable to take advantage of customers. I’ve had excellent experiences with other HVAC companies and strongly recommend avoiding this one.",

  "text": "I’m in the middle of some home renovations and discovered that whoever installed the HVAC system had the brilliant idea to remove structural studs to make room for ductwork. Great planning, right? So, I stopped by Mingledorff’s to see about getting supplies to fix the mess.\n\nThe guy who helped me was polite and professional. No complaints there. But then, his coworker—let’s call her \"HVAC Karen\"—felt the need to chime in uninvited. With the utmost seriousness, she HIGHLY recommended that I “hire a professional who knows what they’re doing.” Oh, you mean like the genius who cut out the structural studs? Thanks for the advice, but I’ll pass. I didn’t bother telling her I’ve engineered HVAC systems before because, honestly, I was too busy resisting the urge to ask if she also HIGHLY recommends hiring a landscaper before planting a tomato.\n\nLook, I get it—wholesale only. No problem. But the condescending lecture? Yeah, no thanks. I’m not about to pay $300/hr for someone to do ductwork that a monkey with opposable thumbs could handle. It’s sad that we’ve reached a point where basic home repairs are considered some kind of forbidden arcane knowledge.\n\nTwo stars: One for the helpful guy, zero for the attitude, and a bonus point for HVAC Karen giving me a free comedy show.",

I would want a plumber and a HVAC company to have a circle of respect from all angles in order to work in my home. I would never do business with this company. I strongly suggest you don't either.",
